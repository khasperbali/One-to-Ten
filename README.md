1 Fish 2 Many Fish (cont.) // create a conditional that checks the count variable // check if the count is greater than 2 // console.log 'We have to many elephants' where the animal is the animal variable and an 's' added to the animal. // if the first condition is false console.log 'Welcome to the club'

Assemble the Avengers // create a variable named hero and set the value to any avenger as a string

// create a function named avengersAssemble that takes one parameter avenger // inside the function create a conditional to check the parameter. // console.log and concat the parameter with a different message based on which avenger assembles if the condition is true // create four conditions, one for ironman, captain america, black widow and a default to console.log('Sorry, you are not needed for this mission')
